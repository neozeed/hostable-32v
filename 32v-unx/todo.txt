The biggest thing is a block driver. I've started this with ansidisk.c but I'm starting to figure out
how the strategy thing works.....  unix.fs is a small filesystem generated with v6_on_286.zip (sorta)

The console driver sucks big time, but it can display output
There is no clock!
The port still has way too much VAX stuff (look @ conf.c)
The goal is to have device drivers that work under the guest
OS's native clib.  Eventually it would be cool to try to
host this under oslib or oskit, so that we can have
a native 32v.
