0.1d	Updated Makefile for OS X, and changed off_t to U_off_t to not clash with stdio.h
0.1c	Added a make file & fixed it to compile with gcc 2.5.8 / 2.7.7.2 & OpenWatcom 1.3
	Note due to a mmap collision this does *NOT* work under FreeBSD & OpenBSD.
	Ive tested under OpenWatcom 1.3, Netbsd, Solaris 10 x86, NeXTSTEP 3.3 (x86 & m68k). 
0.1b	I re-examined the source to the rk driver from the pdp11's v7 source, and re-did the disk
	driver. I'm not actually doing IO yet, but I want to verify that the buffers are working
	correctly...
0.1a	I fleshed out some more of the missing.c stuff. Now I'm trying to verify the filesystem.
	It does look screwed up though...
0.1	I found some docs on the strategy for the devices drivers. I have implemented a crappy 
	device driver for file system access.. I need to verify that it works...
	I'm including a severly modified (screwed up?) version of mkfs from v6_on_286.  It's based
	on V6, so I'm really wondering if the FS will work.. more than likely I'm doing the buffer
	all wrong on this one, but I'll test it again later...
0.0	First verision! It compiles, and goes into the slp.c main scheduler! Plenty is missing though!
	This hardly works correctly!
